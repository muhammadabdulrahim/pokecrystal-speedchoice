# Team Bean Crystal Bingo

This is a disassembly of Pokémon Crystal. It makes modifications from the default [Speedchoice](https://github.com/Dabomstew/pokecrystal-speedchoice) package in order to accommodate in-house bingo rules of Team Bean. The rule changes are shown below. The emojis indicate which tasks are done and which are not.

> ❌ Allow for easier time resets in the game menus.
>
> ✔️ Move the Route 36 Sudowoodo one tile to the left in order to enable early Goldenrod City.
>
> ❌ To better balance the bingo board with the above change, require 2 gym badges to obtain the Bicycle.
>
> ❌ Enable the Goldenrod City GS Ball event, require the Hivebadge for it.

These compensations change some of the bingo board requirements, as it is now possible to skip the Fly HM.

* Remove "Give a Pokémon a haircut" goal
* Add "Insert GS Ball into Ilex Forest shrine" goal

More compensations and edits may be added in the future.
