# Pokémon Crystal

This is a disassembly of Pokémon Crystal. It makes modifications from the default [Speedchoice package](https://github.com/Dabomstew/pokecrystal-speedchoice) in order to accommodate in-house bingo rules of Team Bean. It branches from the 5.1b1 ROM. The rule changes are shown below. The emojis indicate which tasks are done and which are not.

> ✔️ Allow for easier time resets in the game menus.
>
> ✔️ Enable the GS Ball event, triggered from entering.
>
> ❌ Default sound settings to STEREO.
>
> ❌ Randomize the static Celebi encounter.
>
> ❌ Restore Clair event in Dragon's Den.
